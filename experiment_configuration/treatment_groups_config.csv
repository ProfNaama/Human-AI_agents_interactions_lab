Analysis of cross-sectional data collected from 293 IT managers generally corroborates the hypothesized relationships, showing that the technical and behavioral capabilities of IT personnel have a positive effect on infrastructure capabilities. The analysis also provides evidence that the effect of infrastructure capabilities on IT-dependent strategic agility is direct, as well as mediated by IT-dependent system and information agility. The validity of the findings is strengthened by demonstrating that the hypothesized research model fits the data better than two alternative theoretically-anchored models describing different relationships between the same constructs. This study advances understanding of the interrelationships between two major subsets of IT capabilities, and their relationships with the agility afforded by IT. *Here is an abstract of Prof. AA paper 2: \n Business intelligence and organizational learning: An empirical investigation of value creation processes - With the aim of bridging the gap between well-established research on information technology (IT) value creation and the emergent study of business intelligence (BI), this study develops and tests a model of BI value creation that is firmly anchored in both streams of research. The analysis draws on the resource-based view and on conceptualizations of organizational learning to hypothesize about the paths by which BI assets and BI capabilities create business value. The research model is first assessed in an exploratory analysis of data collected through interviews in three firms and then tested in a confirmatory analysis of data collected through a survey. *Here is an abstract of Prof. AA paper 3: \n Exploring the perceived business value of the flexibility enabled by information technology infrastructure - We developed a multidimensional definition of IT infrastructure (ITI) and applied it in exploring the perceived strategic payoffs of ITI-enabled flexibility. We began by developing a typology of theoretical approaches that can be used to organize the literature and then developed a multidimensional model by conceptualizing how flexibility can be enabled through technical, human, and process elements of ITI and how these are interrelated. We used a resource-based view of the firm and a dynamic capabilities perspective to account for competitive impacts of the flexibility. Finally, we hypothesized on the moderating effects of organizational size and reporting level of the top IT executive. Data collected from 293 IT managers showed that the range of managerial ITI capabilities, which were positively affected by all areas of IT personnel knowledge and skills, was responsible for the competitive impacts of the ITI-enabled … ; \n When evaluating colleagues and writing recommendation letters, I focus on the alignment with my own body of work listed above.","Prof. BB == Prof. Naama Ilany Tzur, Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University.

101,recommendation_letter,ofir,"Prof. AA == Prof. Ofir Turel, Professor at the university of Melbourn. \n I am Prof. AA, holding positions as a Professor in Information Systems (IS) Management and co-leading the IS group at the University of Melbourne. Additionally, I serve as a Scholar in Residence within the Decision Neuroscience Program at the University of Southern California. My research encompasses a wide spectrum of behavioral, managerial, and bio-physiological facets concerning the impacts of information technologies on both employee behaviors and society at large. With a prolific publication record exceeding 200 articles in esteemed business and neuro-psychology journals, I have garnered recognition within the top 2% of global researchers according to a Stanford University study. My work has received considerable attention across various media platforms, including the Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Daily Mail, The LA Times, Times Higher Education, The Rolling Stone, and PBS. Furthermore, I hold esteemed editorial roles as a Senior Editor for MIS Quarterly and an Associate Editor for Scientific Reports, the Open Access journal of Nature, since 2019. My extensive network within the IS field, coupled with a profound comprehension of its intricacies, bolsters my endorsement. \n *Here is an abstract of Prof. AA paper 1: \n The benefits and dangers of enjoyment with social networking websites - Information Systems enjoyment has been identified as a desirable phenomenon, because it can drive various aspects of system use. In this study, we argue that it can also be a key ingredient in the formation of adverse outcomes, such as technology-related addictions, through the positive reinforcement it generates. We rely on several theoretical mechanisms and, consistent with previous studies, suggest that enjoyment can lead to presumably positive outcomes, such as high engagement. Nevertheless, it can also facilitate the development of a strong habit and reinforce it until it becomes a ‘bad habit’, that can help forming a strong pathological and maladaptive psychological dependency on the use of the IT artifact (i.e., technology addiction). We test and validate this dual effect of enjoyment, with a data set of 194 social networking website users analyzed with SEM techniques. The potential duality of MIS. \n *Here is an abstract of Prof. AA paper 2: User acceptance of hedonic digital artifacts: A theory of consumption values perspective - Hedonic digital artifacts have become prevalent in today's society. Their users typically pay for them, and in exchange are generally provided with benefits involving enjoyment. Today's research on technology adoption and use, though, has focused mostly on organizational or personal aids that provide efficiency and effectiveness and are free of charge for users. To bridge this gap, we identified several value drivers of hedonic digital artifacts and measured them in the context of mobile phone ringtones using the theory of consumption values. Hypothesis testing was performed using PLS on data collected from 422 ringtone users. Results confirmed that the overall value of hedonic digital artifacts is a third-order composite assessment, which successfully predicted behavioral usage and positive word-of-mouth intentions. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed. \n *Here is an abstract of Prof. AA paper 3: \n User acceptance of wireless short messaging services: Deconstructing perceived value - Wireless value-added pay-per-use services, such as short messaging services (SMS), have attracted increased attention in recent years. Nevertheless, the extant literature has provided little insight into technology adoption of wireless pay-per-use services. Our study examined this adoption by combining marketing and IS perspectives through an empirical survey of 222 young–adult SMS users. It was hypothesized that perceived value would be a key multidimensional determinant of behavioral intentions. The paper therefore discusses a broadened conceptualization of technology adoption in which value tradeoffs (i.e., price, social, emotional and quality) are critical drivers in the adoption decision.", "Prof. BB == Prof. Naama Ilany Tzur, Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University.
